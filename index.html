      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Alas you have stumbled upon this virtual page in a sea of virtual books. Was it fate that brought you here, eyes kneeling before the bright contrast of the tiny millions of dots that fornicate to create such imagery? I dare say that it was your destiny to be here in this very moment to gain insight into the human that is I! (See above)</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>My lineage can be traced back farther than I know. I was born of two aerial warriors that were chosen by the gods themselves to create the ultimate form of mediocrity. In a small village; Spanaway of Washington, I grew and honed my skills for procrastination like my life depended on it. The breeze from the Mountain Dew still lingers in my mind almost as if I could taste it. Only code red though of course.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hobbies come and go for those of you not educated in the subject. Skills are what I possess and as fortune would have it, there are many at my disposal. Here is a list:
        
        Frolicking
        Sensual lute strumming
        Various athletic activites such as ball-kick and fisticuffs
        Vibracious throat singing
        Scooping ice cream
        Folding linens
        Enjoying animated foreign picture shows

        The amount and variety of skills I possess is too extensive to continue. Better if you find out for yourself.

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>With complete honesty I am still reading into what my true purpose is. I've always had a passion for creating and developing in a digital world but of course it is the one skill I lack. For a the job of my dreams I would most likely choose business owner.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>After I graduated from the prestigious Spanaway school of "Being unprepared for life", I was forced to relocate to the neighboring land of Tacoma.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been fascinated with the web. The ideas that brew in my mind are painted like pictures and they leave just as fast as they come. Never having the tangible skills to implement these ideas, I decided to take matters into my own hands and get educated for the benefit of myself and my business partners.</p>
